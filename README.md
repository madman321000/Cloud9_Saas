[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App.

This is a website based of a tutorial from Upskill. It is a Ruby on Rails website that is for a fictional startup called DevMatch, which allows Developers, Entrepreneurs, and Investors to meet. The site has 2 options to register, a free account or a pro account for $10 a month. Once a member is logged in they can view other members and free members can only view some of the other members information while the pro account members can view all of the information.

The login system is created using the devise gem and the payment portal is done with Figaro and Stripe.
